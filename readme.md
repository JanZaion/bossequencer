## Overview

Live at [https://janzaion.github.io/interactivebeats/](https://janzaion.github.io/interactivebeats/)

This project was inspired by Ableton Live's session view. I have composed all the loops in Live.

Main dependencies of this project are React and Tone.js. React handles the generation of UI components and Tone.js handles semi-sample accurate timing of the music loops.
