## Overview

Live at [https://JanZaion.github.io/bossequencer](https://JanZaion.github.io/bossequencer)

This project was inspired by Ableton Live's session view. I have composed all the loops in Live.

Main dependencies of this project are React and Tone.js. React handles the generation of UI components and Tone.js handles semi-sample accurate timing of the music loops.

## Features Under Development

- **Track fetching**: the app should be able to store more music loops and to populate the sequencer with different music loops on request
- **Savable and sharable configuration**: once a set of loops is loaded, the configuration of the active pads should be sharable via URL or a similar method, ie bossequencer/trackName?1342
- **Visualization**: some form of basic visualization, ie FFT

## Contribution

Are you a developer? Awesome! Feel free to raise an issue or to fork and improve upon this project. Are you a music producer? Awesome! Lets get in touch, I'd be happy to feature your loops.
